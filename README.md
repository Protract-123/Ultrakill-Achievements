# Ultrakill Achievements

Adds 40+ achievements to Ultrakill, will probably be useless when ultrakill releases but it's a fun project.
<br>I recommend to start a new save file to really enjoy the experience

How to Install:
<br>
Download the zip file in releases.
<br>
Watch the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNiXcbPh_s
<br>
Drop the contents of the zip folder into the plugins folder
<br>
<br>
You can suggest achivements by creating an issue. You can also let me know of any bugs there

Also UltraAchivementCore used by this mod is my fork of ZedDev's project, which you can find here: https://github.com/Protract-123/UltraAchievement-Core
